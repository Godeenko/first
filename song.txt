Do not speak, Do not speak
Do not speak, Do not speak
Do, not speak,

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

[Verse 1, ST1M]:
I walk into the spotlights through the darkness
Let it not be criminal in appearance, I will take this threshold.
To spite those who did not believe and closed the doors in front of me,
I'm no stranger to, I'll jump over the cliff again.

And let me now and then strive to clip my wings,
I have not lost my self-control yet, although probably harsh,
An icy mind, despite an extremely hot temper,
Everyone has a conscience, but not everyone gets in the way of lying.

And I'm on the right track, although the web is dear,
I have enough faith and good shoes to get there.
I'm here alone with the twists and turns of the sky, I won't retreat,
No matter how convincing the argument is.

I was brought up this way, it is sung in my actions,
I don't give a damn that all this is inaccessible to the crowd.
I am honest with myself, this is the main thing here, and,
As long as there is room to grow, my plans grow here.

Do not speak, Do not speak
To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

[Verse 2, ST1M]:
I walk into the spotlights through the darkness
I will do everything to eventually overcome my fear.
The heart tells where cold calculation is powerless,
I am answering the question before I was asked.

The power is to do silently while others speak
And such an alignment is definitely unlikely to be out of hand.
Success loves silence, they usually shout out of despair,
The arrogant ambition of all exposes them perfectly

The results are more eloquent than any tirade,
Everyone has mistakes, no matter how much you have not erased them from fate.
If yesterday was unlucky, it's not a fact that tomorrow will be the same
Even in a storm, the internal compass will show you the right way.

Defeat, only the one who does not fight does not tolerate
The night will end and a new sun will rise in the morning.
I am honest with myself, this is the main thing here, and,
As long as there is room to grow, my plans grow here.

[Chorus]:
Do, not speak,
Do, not speak,
Do, not speak,

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.

To do, not speak, our whole life is a ring.
Do, not speak, and you are the favorite on it.
To do, not to speak, the thirst for victory is in the blood.
Do not speak, do not speak.
